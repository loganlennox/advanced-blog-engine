# Advanced Blogging Engine

This is a python powered blogging engine that could be used for large scale applications. This engine is unlike many others due to the fact that it supports the ability to have multiple authors and give a performance assessment on each of them. Thereby making it possible to maintain a staff of authors.

## Features
- CMS that enables authors to publish articles and allows readers to anonymously publish comments and upvote the article
- Manager/Admin accounts that are able to oversee all author accounts and their analytics
- Slightly modified version of a markdown editor for article creation
- Search engine

## Dependencies
- Flask (python)
